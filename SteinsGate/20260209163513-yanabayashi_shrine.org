* After-thoughts


* Details
** It is located on the other side of Kanda River.
** Detailed navigation guide:
  1. Enter the first road after crossing Manseibashi Bridge.
  2. Once you reach a gate, go through it, and it will be right along the river.
** Multi-tenant buildings surrounding the small sized shrine doesn't gel well aesthetically.
