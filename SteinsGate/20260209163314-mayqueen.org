* Details
** Full name: MayQueen+Nyan^2
** A maid cafe famous for 3D cat maids.
** Regular customer: [[id:a1004a17-e9c0-4284-aebb-b925d4509a1f][Daru]]
** Location (3 minute walk from Rintaro's lab):
       1. Coming from Kuramaebashi-dori, take a left at Tsumakoisaka Crossing
       2. Look around for the shop
** Typically busy in the summer break but now it's even busier because of the Radi-Kan incident.
** [[id:ec77fd83-5cf4-484e-a1f3-890f1b351c08][Mayuri]] also works part-time at this place under the alias 'Mayushii NyanNyan'. Because of her,  [[id:cf5e0883-ac65-423b-8671-457f1a6c99b2][Rintaro]] also comes by at least twice a month.
** Cat-eared maids here at MayQueen+Nyan^2 are required to add cat sounds-*nyas* and *nyans*-to their words with some frequency.
**  [[id:9379d0c6-cbaf-4b51-80a6-2f79a391e98d][Faris]] and Mayushii are the top two cat maids at the cafe.
** Apparently, maid cafe fans are divided over cat ears. We have two factions brewing up,
       1. Maids don't have cat ears!
       2. Cat Ears + Maid = 2X Moe!
