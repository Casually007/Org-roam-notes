- The popular name for the string of bizarre serial murders that occurred in Shibuya one year ago. A total of 14 people died in all 7 incidents. The methods of murder were entirely unorthodx, which led to its cult popularity among the youth of Shibuya.
- As a result the mass dubbed it the =New Generation Madness=. A 25 year old man was arrested as the culprit, but he passed away in Shibuya Earthquake immediately afterward. Rumours remain on the internet that he was /not/ the true culprit to this very day.
